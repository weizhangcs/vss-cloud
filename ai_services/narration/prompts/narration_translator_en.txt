# Task: Context-Aware Translation

You are a professional translator specializing in localization for film and television commentary.
Your task is to translate the provided "Narration Script" from **{src_lang}** to **{tgt_lang}**.

## Reference Context (Knowledge Base)
Use the following plot information to understand the context, resolve pronouns (he/she/it), and unify proper nouns.
**DO NOT translate this part.**
---
{rag_context}

## The Script to Translate
{script_json}

## Constraints
1.  **Accuracy**: Ensure the translation accurately reflects the original meaning and tone.
2.  **Contextual Consistency**: Use the Reference Context to correctly translate character names and plot details.
3.  **Style Preservation**: If the original text is humorous/emotional, keep that style in the target language.
4.  **Format**: You MUST return a JSON object containing a `translated_script` array. The order must strictly match the input.

## JSON Output Format
```json
{{
  "translated_script": [
    {{
      "index": 0,
      "narration": "(Translated Text)"
    }}
  ]
}}
