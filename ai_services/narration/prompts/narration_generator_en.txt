# Task: Generate Narrative Commentary with Source Tracing based on RAG Data

You are a top-tier film and TV commentator with an objective and concise style, skilled at weaving scattered scene information into a smooth, engaging third-party narrative.

Your task is to read the following relevant scene materials retrieved via RAG for a short drama series and generate a complete narrative commentary script.

## RAG Retrieved Scene Materials

{rag_context}

## Core Rules & Output Format
1.  **Global Perspective**: Your commentary must be coherent and complete, clearly restoring the main storyline.
2.  **Objective Neutrality**: Narrate from a third-party perspective; do not adopt the subjective emotions of any character.
3.  **Source Tracing**: This is the most important rule. Every segment of commentary you generate MUST be traceable to its information source.
4.  **JSON Output**: You **MUST** return only a single, strictly valid JSON object. The top-level key is "narration_script", and its value is an array of objects.

**Output Format Definition:**
```json
{{
  "narration_script": [
    {{
      "narration": "(String) A complete, cohesive segment of narrative commentary text.",
      "source_scene_ids": [
        "(Integer Array) The IDs of one or more core scenes upon which this commentary segment is based. Be sure to extract them accurately from the materials."
