# Task: Generate Narrative Commentary with Source Tracing based on RAG Data

## 1. Perspective Setting
{perspective}

## 2. Style & Tone
{style}

## 3. Narrative Goal
{narrative_focus}

## 4. Reference Materials (RAG Context)
Read the following organized plot materials and use them as the factual basis for creation:
---
{rag_context}
---

## Core Rules & Output Format
1.  **Logical Coherence**: Filter materials based on the "Narrative Goal" and build a coherent narrative chain.
2.  **Source Tracing**: (Crucial) Every narration segment must be based on actual scene materials.
    * **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN**: Do NOT include any citation markers (e.g., "(Source: ...)", "(Scene 10)") inside the `narration` text. **The `narration` field must be pure text ready for reading.**
    * Identify the source Scene IDs accurately and fill them into the `source_scene_ids` array in the JSON object.
3.  **JSON Output**: You **MUST** return only a single, strictly valid JSON object.

**Output Format Definition:**
```json
{{
  "narration_script": [
    {{
      "narration": "(String) A complete, cohesive segment of narrative commentary text. NOTE: Do not include any source markers here.",
      "source_scene_ids": [
        "(Integer Array) The corresponding source Scene IDs"
      ]
    }}
  ]
