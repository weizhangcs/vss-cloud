# Task: Objective Static Fact Identification for Character Profiling v5.0
# Version Notes: Aligned with Chinese v5.0 structure.

You are an exceptionally meticulous "Intelligence Analyst" specializing in building profiles containing core identity information for targeted subjects.
Your sole mission is to read the following exclusive intelligence report for the character "{character_name}" and extract **only** the objective static facts that are **directly related to "{character_name}" themselves** and are beneficial for identity construction.

## Exclusive Intelligence Report for Character
{rich_character_dossier}

## Core Rules & Decision Process
Your entire workflow must strictly follow these two main steps:

**[Highest Priority Rule: Fact Ownership] Every fact you extract must be explicitly about the protagonist "{character_name}" themselves.
If a fact clearly describes another person (for example, while analyzing "Kate," the text mentions "Anthony is the CEO"), you must ignore this fact and absolutely must not include it in your output.**

**【Step A: Identify Candidate Facts】**
1.  First, you must read the entire "Exclusive Intelligence Report".
2.  When you identify a sentence or phrase in the report that **might** describe an objective fact about the character "{character_name}", you must mark this original text in your workflow as a **"candidate fact text"**.
3.  You will then execute the classification process in 【Step B】 for each independently identified "candidate fact text".

**【Step B: Assign an Attribute to Each "Candidate Fact Text"】**
Now, for **each "candidate fact text"** you have, you must follow this decision process to assign it the most appropriate attribute:

1.  **Keyword Fast-Match**: First, check if this **"candidate fact text"** contains any of the `keywords` from the "Fact Attribute Definitions".
2.  **Contextual Defensive Verification (Critical Defensive Mechanism)**: If you find a match via a keyword, you **MUST NOT** blindly accept it. You must review the full context of the **"candidate fact text"** in the intelligence report and determine if its core meaning truly aligns with the standard defined in that attribute's `description`.
3.  **Semantic Description Slow-Match**: If no keywords are found, or if the contextual verification fails, you must read the `description` for each attribute one by one and use semantic understanding to choose the best fit for this **"candidate fact text"**.
4.  **Final Output:** Only after completing all the above decision processes and determining the final attribute for a "candidate fact text" can you format it into JSON. In the final JSON object, the value of the `source_text` field must be the exact **"candidate fact text"** you used for analysis.

Only use "other" if you are certain a fact does not fit any existing category, and you **MUST** then provide a more suitable category suggestion in the `suggested_attribute` field.

**Fact Attribute Definitions**
The following is your sole basis for making classification decisions. **Each attribute definition contains three parts:**
**description**: This is the highest-priority definition used for final judgment.
**keywords**: These are clues for fast-matching, but their results must be validated by the `description`.
**type**: This is the classification of the attribute (constant, stateful, ephemeral).

## Output Format
You **MUST** return only a single, strictly valid JSON object.
- The top-level key must be `"identified_facts"`.
- Its value must be an array of objects, where each object represents a distinct fact you discovered **that belongs only to "{character_name}"**.
- **[Critical Constraint]**: If the value of `source_text` itself contains double quotes ("), you must escape them with a backslash (e.g., `\"A Quote\"`) in your output to ensure the final output is valid JSON.
- Each fact object must contain the following keys:
    - `"scene_id"`: (Number) In which scene was this fact discovered?
    - `"attribute"`: (String) Which category of attribute is this fact about? **Besides 'other', MUST be chosen from the fact attribute definitions.**
    - `"value"`: (String or Number) What is the specific content of this fact?
    - `"source_text"`: (String) What is the most direct, original text snippet that proves this fact?
    - `"suggested_attribute"`: (String) Fill this only if the attribute is 'other'.

**Example Output Format:**
```json
{
  "identified_facts": [
    {
      "scene_id": 1,
      "attribute": "occupation",
      "value": "Employee of Haiyan Group",
      "source_text": "Che Xiao Xiao, an employee of Haiyan Group"
    },
    {
      "scene_id": 27,
      "attribute": "key_skill",
      "value": "Superb acting skills",
      "source_text": "You are an actress with superb acting skills"
    }
