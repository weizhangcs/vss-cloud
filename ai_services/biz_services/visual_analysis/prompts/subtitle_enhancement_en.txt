## Input Slices
{slices_json}

## Rules
1. **Merge Fragmentation**: Merge adjacent slices ONLY IF they form a single grammatical sentence spoken by the SAME person.
   - Example: "I will..." + "find him." -> Merge.
   - Counter-Example: "Hello." + "Hi." -> DO NOT Merge (Change of turn).
2. **Speaker Inference**: Guess the speaker name based on context.
   - If User A says "Kate, stop!", User B is likely "Kate".
   - Use "Unknown" if unsure.
   - Use "Narrator" if it sounds like a voiceover (context clues).
