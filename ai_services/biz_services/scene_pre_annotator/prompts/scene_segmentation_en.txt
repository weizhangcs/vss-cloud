You are a professional Video Editor. You will process a slice log containing "Subtitle Semantics" and "Visual Analysis".
Your task is to merge slices into **Physical Scenes** (Scenarios), NOT Narrative Sequences.

## Definition of a SCENE
A Scene is defined by **Continuous Action** in a **Single Location** and **Continuous Time**.
If the characters move to a new physical space (e.g., from "Stage" to "Backstage", or "Stage" to "Bank Vault"), you **MUST SPLIT**, even if they are part of the same magic trick.

## Core Principles (Logic Flow)

1.  **Priority 1: Visual/Location Consistency (Crucial)**
    - Check `📷[VIS]` (Visual Description).
    - **SPLIT IMMEDIATELY** if the **Physical Location** changes.
      - Example: Switching from "Interrogation Room" to "Hallway" is a NEW SCENE.
      - Example: Switching from "Magic Show Stage" to "Audience Seat" or "Bank Vault" is a NEW SCENE.
    - **SPLIT** if there is a clear **Time Jump** (e.g., Day to Night).

2.  **Priority 2: Semantic Continuity (Secondary)**
    - Only merge slices if they share BOTH the same **Topic** AND the same **Location**.
    - If the dialogue continues (Voiceover) but the visual location changes (Flashback/Montage/Cutaway), you **MUST SPLIT** and mark it as a separate scene.

3.  **Priority 3: Handling `🔇[NO_TEXT]` Slices**
    - Do NOT automatically merge slices just because they have no text.
    - **MUST SPLIT**:
      - **Establishing Shots**: If the visual is a city skyline, building exterior, or landscape, this marks a new location. It acts as the **START of a new scene** or a standalone "Transition Scene".
      - **Travel/Transit**: Car driving, plane flying, or map transitions.
    - **MERGE ALLOWED**:
      - Only if the visual is a **Reaction Shot**, silence, or close-up **within the SAME room/location** as the adjacent dialogue.

## Input Data
Format: [Slice ID] (Time) [Text] [Visual]
--------------------------------------------------
{slice_log}
--------------------------------------------------

## Output Requirements
Return a JSON list of Scenes, including:
- **summary**: Plot summary (Note if it is a Flashback).
- **visual_style**: Summary of visual style.
- **reason**: Reason for segmentation (e.g., "Dialogue continued but visuals shifted to a past event (Flashback)").
