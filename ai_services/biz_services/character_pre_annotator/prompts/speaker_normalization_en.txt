## Core Instructions
1. **Analyze**: Identify different name variations that refer to the same person (e.g., "Tony" -> "Tony Stark", "Mr. Stark" -> "Tony Stark").
2. **Standardize**: Choose the most complete and formal name as the "Standard Name".
3. **Map**: Create a mapping from "Original Name" to "Standard Name". Fix typos and merge aliases.
